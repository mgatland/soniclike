soniclike
=========

Making a game engine that's a little bit like Sonic the Hedgehog 2

Setup:
Clone the git repository.
Open eclipse, add existing project.
Open GameExample.java and run that as a java application.

Controls:
Left and right arrows to move
Up to teleport to the starting position (if you fall off)
Z jumps
X 'dashes'. If you're going uphill and have slowed down too much, mash X to go faster. (This is my alternative to Sonic 2's spindash move.)

You cannot crouch or roll into a ball (this isn't sonic :)
But you can run around loops and go upside-down.
