sonic todo:

Gimmicks:
[ ] horizontal springs
[ ] vertical springs
[ ] diagonal springs
[ ] drop-away platforms
[ ] moving platforms
[ ]  big mario\small mario type transformation?

character
[ ] animation :o

Geometry:
[ ] loop-de-loops
[ ] jump-up-throughable terrain

[ ] when a ceiling and floor slope together, sonic can get stuck by his wall-sensors
	when both the ceiling and ground sensor go off it's probably a sign to stop.
[ ] allow sonic to stand on tiny platforms.
[ ] walking up hills is too hard - 45 degree slopes should be slow but steady.
[ ] at less than 60 degrees, drag shouldn't affect you while slowly walking
[ ] make collision checks more rigorous than in old sonic
	it should be provably impossible for sonic to pop through terrain. maybe.
	the floor can push sonic up through a ceiling at the moment
	if the floor is narrower than sonic's feet, sonic will fall through it.
[ ] the new checks to prevent momentary rotations can cause sonic to fall off on the outside of curves.
	because sonic 	refuses to rotate, so runs off the edge.

[x] really fixed the popping-through walls bug (instead of shifting it from vertical movement to horizontal movement)
[x] sonic 'trudges' up steep slopes i.e. slips less.
[x] converted graphics to OpenGL using LWJGL.

[x] fixed a popping-through-walls bug.

did a trivial start to adding map entities (level editor - press i)
they don't save or do anything or have collision checks etc i'm tired.

[x] higher acceleration than the original Sonic - easier to get up to speed.
[x] added some 'rolling' (doesn't actually make sonic shorter)
[x] jumping sideways now gives a sideways boost
[x] reduced vertical boost from jumping while running uphill.
[x] fixed a teleport bug when hitting a ceiling, while sideways, in negative coords.

thinking about Mirror's Edge 2D - why is it more fun than my prototype?
there's more to do and more feeling of speed.
animation, sound etc.
Wall running is uninteresting to me, and wall jumping is overdone 
(and done to perfection in Super Meat Boy) -
but sliding is a good mechanic that i could steal, and a good substitute
for rolling.

[x] don't flicker between two angle modes - don't change angle mode unless it will stick.
[x] tidied up the wall checks handing of rotation
[x] added extra trace-lines checking for walls so Sonic won't walk "under" high walls.
- [x] fixed: when the ceiling and floor get close together, sonic can walk through the ceiling

Rewrote Level using vector lines instead of a huge bitmap. Should be much better.
Tried rewriting Sonic with true rotation, quickly gave up.
The existing Sonic will be fine with a few tweaks.
[x] wall and ceiling checks must work in all modes.

and earlier.

[x] in a large loop-de-loop you can get stuck in horizontal mode on the side
   - an almost-sheer-cliff must never be detected as horizontal.
[x] angles on the edge of flat platforms are awful.
	fix is the reverse foot check.
